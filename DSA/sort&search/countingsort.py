"""
Counting sort is an integer sorting algorithm for a collection of objects that sorts according to the keys of the object

Steps:
1. Construct a working array C that has size equal to the range of the input array A.
2. Iterate through A, assigning C[x] based on the number of times x appeared in A.
3. Transform C into an array where C[x] refers to the number of values â‰¤ x by iterating through the array,
assigning to each C[x] the sum of its prior value and all values in C that come before it.
4. Iterate backwards through A, placing each value in to a new sorted array B at the index recorded in C. This is
done for a given A[x] by assigning B[C[A[x]]] to A[x], and decrementing C[A[x]] in case there were duplicate
values in the original unsorted array.
"""
#Time and space
"""
We only use a count array of length O(k) which is the range of values in the input
Time is O(n + k) because we iterate through the count array as well as the input array at least once

Stable algorithm that is a non comparison
